<h1>How to Use SnapAssist</h1>
<p>To search for photography locations for the subject matter of your choice, type
your keywords into the box.  SnapAssist will then perform a keyword search to find the
relevant photos in its database, cluster the photos using their geolocations, and
plot the photos and clusters on a map.</p>

</center>

<p>On the map, the centre of each cluster is denoted with a blue pin. Clicking the
pin expands it to give summary statistics and representative photos (and their
EXIF data).  The cluster's longitude and latitude are determined by averaging
the long-lat of the cluster's photos, weighted by the number of views each photo has.
The cluster's rank (#1, above) is determined by ordering the clusters' average number of
views per photo divided by the number of photos in the cluster (a joint measure of the
quality of the photos taken at a location and how original the location is).</p>
